\caption[A Transiton to Cooperation]{A Transition to Cooperation in a Prisoner's
Dilemma ($T=5$,$R=4$,$P=1$,$S=0$, and 10 rounds).
In this transition the system moves from mutual defection ($\{1,1\}$) to
mutual cooperation ($\{0,0\}$) as shown in the bottom panel.  Both populations
(top two panels)
are initially dominated by Always Defect strategies.  The transition begins with
a wave of Grim Trigger strategies arising in both populations, quickly followed by a rise in Tit-For-Tat.  As the transition is completed, both populations are
dominated by Tit-For-Tat.
